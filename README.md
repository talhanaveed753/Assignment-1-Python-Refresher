Coding Homework for TICS1

Files:

echo.py - Code for echo program, simulates a echo in the mountains
codeAndOutputFor-echoPy (PNG) - Contains the code and the program output for echo.py after running with inputs "echo 123" and "Helloooo"
fib.py - Code to calculate nth fib terms and time each consecutive calculation
codeFor-fibPy (PNG) - Contains the code for fib.py which calculates how long each nth fib number takes to calculate (to 100) and graphs the data
outputFor-fibPy (TXT) - Contains the program output for fib.py with time taken to calculate each nth fib term and each nth fib value
graphForFibCalculations (PNG) - Graph that is output after fib.py completes successfully, contains line graph showing time relation to fib calcs

I noticed the calculation time between fib terms 77 and 78 had a significant jump, I was unable to determine how to optimize the program any further.

I experienced some difficulty with importing functools and matplotlib and with figuring out how to use venv.
